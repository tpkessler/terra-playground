-- block in the destructor.

-- Work distribution has to be handled carefully to guarantee correct
-- bookkeeping of the number of working threads and the size of work queue.

-- The barrier check should go last to not provoke an early done_condition
-- resolution. If checked in the very beginning it would happen the
-- threads_working field is 0 without checking the size of the work queue
-- before.
